# pipthing

This is a repository to mark my progress on my programming abilities.
Specific requests for certain things will be considered but might not be inclouded.
Bug reports will be reconized and I will try to fix them.

There is better suff then mine and I would not sugest using my library but if you would like to help me I would appreciate it.

(seriously don't use my library in your code if your not trying to help me it will probably make your code worse)
